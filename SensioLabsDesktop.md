# Christmas 1984

### First computer:
- Amstrad CPC 664
- Introduced to basic 1.1 immediately

### First game:
- GOLF, Amsoft
- Press SPACE to begin
  - Oh Fabien. Types "space", since no spacebar. Recieves no feedback. Tries again. No luck.
  - Stumbles upon the "space" key. Instructions AFTER necessary.

### Takeaways:
- More explicit directions, like "press the SPACE bar on the keyboard to begin"
- We commonly overcomplicate issues for the user
  - Even the simplest thing to a dev can be difficult to a user

### Relevance to SF2
- Still have "space" issues, but working to remove them
- Make error messages more user friendly
- Solving a problem the right way usually involves more complexity.
